**TicketMaker** is a standalone Windows application designed to simplify creating support tickets in a Freshdesk system. This repository contains the full version of the application.

### Features

- **Rich Text Editor**: Supports formatted text and embedded images in the ticket description.
- **Embedded Image Handling**: Automatically extracts embedded images and sends them as attachments.
- **File Attachments**: Users can upload additional files to include with their tickets.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive fields for entering ticket details.
- **Dropdown Options**: Predefined dropdowns for Priority and Status fields.
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled before submission.
- **Secure API Integration**: Communicates with the Freshdesk API for ticket creation.
- **Interactive and Silent Install Support**: Install the application interactively with user prompts or silently for automated deployments.

### How It Works

1. **Fill in Required Fields**:
   - **Subject**: Short description of the issue.
   - **Description**: Rich text description with support for images.
   - **Email**: Contact email of the requester.
   - **Priority**: Dropdown to select ticket priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent).
   - **Status**: Dropdown to select ticket status (Open, Pending, Resolved, Closed).
   - **Attachments**: Add files to include with the ticket.

2. **Submit Ticket**:
   - The app validates the inputs and extracts embedded images.
   - Submits the ticket details and attachments to the Freshdesk API.
   - Displays a success or error message based on the API response.

3. **Interactive API Configuration**:
   - During installation, the **Configurator** application is launched in interactive mode to collect your Freshdesk API URL and API key.
   - These values are stored securely in the system registry.
   - The **Configurator** can also be run manually to reset the API configuration if needed.

4. **Silent Installation**:
   - TicketMaker supports silent installs for automated deployments. Use the following command in PowerShell to install the application without prompts:
     ```powershell
     msiexec /i "C:\Github\TicketMaker\TicketMakerInstaller.msi" /quiet /log "C:\TicketMakerInstall.log" URL="https://example.com" API_KEY="12345"
     ```

5. **Clear Form**:
   - The fields are reset after successful submission.
   - Embedded images saved during processing are automatically cleaned up.
